# TradingView Script for Ichimoku Crossover
Trading View Script for Ichimoku Crossover between Chikou Span and Senkou Span B.

This is a custom script for Pine Editor in Trading View. It is based on a swing trading strategy given by Aldo Lagrutta in this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_RenLM6rDQ.

I have yet to publish it on TradingView, since I don't have a subscription. But the code can be pasted into Trading View Pine Editor and indicator will still work for one chart.
